# TigerIsland
CEN3031 Term Project - Team K

## Features
There are no features missing as far as game functionality goes. Our AI strategy prioritizes as follows:
  1. Tigers
  2. Meeples
  3. Totoros
We Make sure to rush a win by expending all tigers and after land-grabbing until we run out of meeples so we can win by using up two game pieces.
